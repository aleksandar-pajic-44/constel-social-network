## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

**1. Clone the repository to your local machine:**

`git clone https://github.com/aleksandar-pajic-44/constel-social-network.git`

**2.  Change your working directory to the project folder:**

`cd constel-social-network` 

**3.  Install the project dependencies using npm:**

`npm install` 

## Folder Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure to organize your code and assets effectively. Here's an overview of the important directories and files:

-   `components`: This directory is where all React components are placed.
-   `pages`: Next.js uses this directory to automatically generate pages based on the file structure.
-   `public`: Static assets like images, fonts, and other files go here.
-   `styles`: SCSS stylesheets or global styles for the project.
-   `utils`: Utility functions or modules that can be reused across the application.
-   `services`: Service functions for handling HTTP requests.
-   `models`: Typescript models and types for handling data.

... etc.

## Development

To start a development server and work on your project, use the following command:

`npm run dev` 

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can access your project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). The server will automatically reload when you make changes to your code.

## Production

To build your project for production and prepare it for deployment, use the following command:

`npm run build` 

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

To start the production server, use:

`npm start` 

Your production-ready app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Happy coding!
